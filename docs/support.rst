Getting Support
===============

Community Support
=================

Autofac has a large community that can help you out if you have questions. If you can't find your answer in the documentation, you can...

- `Ask your question on StackOverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/autofac>`_. Be sure to use the ``autofac`` tag in your question.
- `Start a discussion on the forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#forum/autofac>`_. This is a good idea if you have multiple questions or a question that might have a more subjective answer (e.g., "recommendations" sorts of things).

Commercial Support
==================

Several companies offer commercial support for Autofac questions/design issues:

- `Readify <http://readify.net>`_ - training and consulting services
- `CICLO <http://ciclo.pt/>`_ - commercial support and training
- `Continuous IT <http://continuousit.com>`_ - training, troubleshooting and implementation help

Note: while the above listed companies offer help, they are not officially affiliated with the Autofac project.

*If you would like your company listed here, please send an email to the discussion group.*

Filing an Issue
===============
If you're having trouble figuring something out, please do try at least the community support road before filing a question-based issue. We do have a really great set of folks `on StackOverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/autofac>`_, and while we definitely want to help you succeed, there is a *far, far, far smaller audience answering issues*.

If you do find a bug or just can't get an answer elsewhere, please file issues **in the repository corresponding to the library you're having trouble with**. For example, if you're having trouble with Web API integration, file the issue `with the Web API Autofac integration library <https://github.com/autofac/Autofac.WebApi/issues>`_ rather than in the core Autofac project.

**Please include a detailed description of what's going wrong, full exception messages and stack traces, and (ideally) a small reproduction so we can see the problem in action like a failing unit test or a link to a small project.** Including as much information as you can will help us address the issue in a more timely fashion.
